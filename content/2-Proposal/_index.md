## 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

### 1.1 Executive Summary
The Intelligent Scheduling Chatbot on AWS is a fully serverless solution designed to automate appointment booking and customer support through Facebook Messenger.

The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) on Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet) using a Text-to-SQL mechanism to query/execute SQL on a PostgreSQL database for complex scheduling operations and produce accurate, context-aware responses.


**Core Components:**
* **Frontend Layer:** Facebook Messenger integration via Webhook receiver.
* **Processing Layer:** Lambda functions for ChatHandler, Text2SQL Handler, Data Indexer.
* **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL (RDS) for appointment data; DynamoDB for cache/session.
* **AI Layer:** Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Text2SQL) & Claude 3 Haiku/Sonnet (ChatHandler).
* **Admin Dashboard / Consultant Portal:** React app hosted on S3 + CloudFront with Cognito Authentication.

The entire system is deployed on AWS Serverless architecture in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region, ensuring scalability, cost efficiency, and operational reliability.

### 1.3 Assumptions
**Prerequisites & Access:**
* AWS Account & Region: Assumes availability of an active AWS account. Target region is **Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - ap-northeast-1** due to Bedrock model availability.
* Meta (Facebook) Account: Assumes client has valid Meta Developer account. Credentials (App ID, Page Token) are stored in AWS SSM/Secrets Manager.
* Email Verification: Sender email for Amazon SES is verified.

**External Dependencies:**
*	Facebook Messenger Platform: The chatbot’s frontend relies entirely on the stability and availability of the Facebook Messenger Graph API (v18.0). Any significant changes to the Facebook Webhook payload structure or API deprecations may require code updates.
*	LLM Availability: The system depends on the continued availability and quota sufficiency of Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku (for chat logic) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (for Text-to-SQL) within Amazon Bedrock.

**Technical Constraints**
* Language Support: The system prompts and database text search (unaccent extension) are optimized specifically for the Vietnamese language . It is assumed that the primary user base communicates in Vietnamese.
* Data Structure: The project assumes specific CSV file formats (column names, data types) for the initial data import into RDS . Any deviation in the input data schema may cause the initialization or indexing process to fail.
* Serverless Limits: The application logic is constrained by AWS Lambda execution limits (e.g., the Text2SQL and ChatHandler functions have a timeout of 120 seconds). Complex queries or LLM latency exceeding this window may result in timeouts.

**Risks:** 
* LLM Accuracy (Hallucinations): While prompt engineering is used to mitigate errors, it is assumed that there is a non-zero risk of the AI model generating incorrect SQL queries or natural language responses.
* Cost Variance: The project utilizes "pay-as-you-go" services (Bedrock tokens, Lambda invocations). It is assumed the client understands that operational costs will fluctuate based on traffic volume and the complexity of user interactions.
* Data Privacy: Since the database is deployed in a private subnet, it is secure from public access. However, it is assumed that sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling complies with the client's internal data governance policies, as the chatbot processes names, phone numbers, and emails.


## 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram

#### 2.1.1 Architecture Description
The proposed solution utilizes a **Serverless-First** and **Event-Driven** architecture hosted on the AWS Cloud (Region: ap-northeast-1), designed to ensure scalability, security, and cost-efficiency compliant with the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

The architecture is divided into three main logical layers:

1. **Frontend & Presentation Layer:** 
   * Admin Dashboard & Consultant Portal: Hosted as Single Page Applications (SPA) on Amazon S3 and distributed globally via Amazon CloudFront (CDN) for low latency.
   * Chat Interface: Integrates directly with the Facebook Messenger Platform via Webhooks.

2. **Processing & Business Logic Layer (VPC-Secured):**
    * **API Gateway:** Serves as the secure entry point for both the Facebook Webhook and Dashboard API calls.
    * **Asynchronous Processing:** To ensure high availability and decoupling, incoming messages are pushed to Amazon SQS (FIFO) before processing. This prevents data loss during traffic spikes and ensures message ordering.
    * **Compute:** AWS Lambda functions handle all business logic, including webhook verification, chat processing, and admin CRUD operations.
    * **AI Integration:** The system leverages Amazon Bedrock via VPC Interface Endpoints to access Foundation Models (Claude 3 Haiku for intent detection, Claude 3 Sonnet for extraction and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Text-to-SQL generation) securely without traversing the public internet.
3. **Data & Storage Layer:** 
   * **Relational Data:** Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL stores structured data (Consultants, Customers, Appointments). It is deployed in private isolated subnets.
   * **Session Data:** Amazon DynamoDB manages user sessions and conversation context with high-speed read/write capabilities.
   * **Archival:** Amazon S3 is used for storing raw data imports and historical archives via EventBridge scheduled jobs.


#### 2.1.2 Network Infrastructure & Security
* **VPC Isolation:** All core compute (Lambda) and database resources reside in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within Private Isolated Subnets, ensuring no direct exposure to the public internet.
* **VPC Endpoints:** Instead of using NAT Gateways (cost optimization), the architecture uses VPC Gateway Endpoints (for S3, DynamoDB) and Interface Endpoints (for Secrets Manager, Bedrock Runtime) to keep traffic within the AWS network.
* **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito User Pools manage authentication for Admin and Consultant portals. Facebook Messenger validates integrity via HMAC signatures using secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
* **Access Control:** AWS IAM follows the principle of least privilege for all service-to-service interactions.

#### 2.1.3 Data Process Flow

| Step | Flow | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | User → Facebook Messenger | User sends message |
| 2 | FB → API Gateway → WebhookReceiver | Webhook receives & validates event |
| 3 | WebhookReceiver → SQS | Message queued for async processing |
| 4 | SES → User | Send OTP via email |
| 5 | ChatHandler → DynamoDB | Store session & conversation cache |
| 6 | ChatHandler → Claude 3 Haiku | Intent detection |
| 7 | Claude 3 Haiku → Claude 3 Sonnet | Analyze context, user info (INSERT/UPDATE sched.) |
| 8 | Text2SQL Handler → VPC Endpoint → Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Natural language → SQL (SELECT + INSERT/UPDATE) |

### 2.2 Technical Plan
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Deployment** 

The development team will develop scripts using **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2** with Python 3.12. This will allow for quick and repeatable deployments into AWS accounts using standard cdk deploy commands. The entire infrastructure (VPC, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito) is defined in code, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

**Configuration & Approvals**

Some additional configuration such as **Amazon Bedrock Model Access** (specifically for Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), **Facebook App Review** (for pages_messaging permission), and **Amazon SES Production Access** (to move out of the sandbox environment) may require approval and will follow these processes:

**Testing Strategy**

All critical paths will include extensive coverage, specifically:
* Unit Testing: For individual Lambda functions (ChatHandler, Text2SQL) and utility modules.
* Integration Testing: Verifying the end-to-end flow from Facebook Messenger → API Gateway → SQS → SES →  Lambda → Bedrock → RDS.
* Security Testing: verifying IAM least privilege roles and VPC security group rules.

### 2.3 Project Plan (Agile Scrum)

| Month | Phase | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|---|

### 2.4 Security Considerations
The solution implements a "Security by Design" approach, leveraging AWS native security services and best practices to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Security measures are categorized into five key domains:
1.  **Access (Identity & Access Management)** 
      *	IAM Least Privilege: All AWS Lambda functions operate with granular IAM roles that grant only the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., specific DynamoDB table access, restricted Bedrock model invocation), adhering to the principle of least privilege.
      *	User Authentication: Secure authentication for the Admin Dashboard and Consultant Portal is managed via Amazon Cognito User Pools, ensuring centralized identity management and secure token handling.
      *	Webhook Validation: All incoming requests from Facebook Messenger are validated using HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (X-Hub-Signature-256) to ensure message integrity and origin authenticity.
      *	End-User Verification: A secure OTP (One-Time Password) mechanism via Amazon SES is implemented to verify the identity of chat users before processing sensitive booking requests.

2.  **Infrastructure (Network & Compute Security)** 
      * Network Isolation: All backend compute resources (Lambda) and databases (Amazon RDS) are deployed within VPC Private Isolated Subnets, with no direct ingress from the public internet.
      *	VPC Endpoints: Communication between AWS services (Lambda to Bedrock, Secrets Manager, S3, DynamoDB) occurs privately via VPC Interface and Gateway Endpoints, keeping traffic entirely within the AWS network backbone.
      *	Encryption in Transit: All network traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ via Amazon API Gateway and CloudFront.

3.  **Data (Protection & Privacy)** 
      *	Secrets Management: Sensitive credentials (database passwords, Facebook Page Tokens) are stored and retrieved securely from AWS Secrets Manager and SSM Parameter Store. No secrets are hardcoded in the application source code.
      *	SQL Injection Prevention: The Text-to-SQL layer implements strict guardrails, including:
         *	Use of parameterized queries (via psycopg) to neutralize injection attacks.
         *	LLM output validation to strictly match database schema parameters.
         *	Authorization layers to restrict database mutations (INSERT/UPDATE) based on user intent.

4.  **Detection (Logging & Monitoring)** 
      *  Centralized Logging: Application logs, error traces, and access logs are aggregated in Amazon CloudWatch Logs for real-time analysis and troubleshooting
5.  **Incident Management:**
      *	Resilience & Failover: The system includes built-in handling for service throttling (e.g., Bedrock rate limits) and exponential backoff retry mechanisms to maintain stability during incidents.

### 3.3 PATH TO PRODUCTION
The Proof of Concept (POC) is architected to demonstrate the core value proposition of the Intelligent Scheduling Chatbot using a serverless-first approach on AWS. While the POC establishes a functional end-to-end booking flow via Facebook Messenger, it is scoped to validate technical feasibility and user experience rather than to support high-concurrency production workloads immediately.

**Current POC Capabilities & Focus**: The current release focuses on the following targeted use-cases and technical validations:

*	Core Integration: Seamless bi-directional integration with Facebook Messenger via Webhooks and Graph API.
*	Architecture Validation: Validation of the AWS Serverless stack (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, RDS) for cost-efficiency and event-driven processing.
*	AI Logic: Implementation of Text-to-SQL capabilities using Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to accurately query availability and modify schedule data securely.
*	Management Interfaces: A functional Admin Dashboard and Consultant Portal for real-time schedule management and user oversight.
*	Performance: Initial optimization of cold starts and LLM response latency to ensure acceptable user experience.

**Gap Analysis & Production Roadmap**: To transition from the current POC to a fully resilient, enterprise-grade production system, the solution requires further investment in operational excellence, multi-channel support, and advanced analytics. The following roadmap outlines the key phases to address these gaps:
*	Phase 2 - Omni-channel Expansion: Extend the chatbot interface beyond Facebook Messenger to include a Web Widget (for corporate websites) and a dedicated Mobile Application, ensuring a unified customer experience across touchpoints.
*	Phase 3 - AI Cost & Performance Optimization: Transition from general-purpose Foundation Models to Small Language Models (SLMs) fine-tuned specifically for SQL generation tasks. These models will be hosted on Amazon EC2/SageMaker to reduce inference latency and operational costs at scale.
*	Phase 4 - Advanced Data Analytics: Implement an AWS Glue + Amazon Athena pipeline to perform deep analytics on conversation logs and booking trends, enabling data-driven business decisions beyond simple operational reporting.
*	Phase 5 - Operational Excellence & Scalability: Deploy comprehensive auto-scaling strategies across all layers to handle fluctuating traffic loads dynamically. This includes Provisioned Concurrency for Lambda functions to eliminate cold starts, storage auto-scaling for RDS, and EC2 Auto Scaling Groups for the fine-tuned LLM inference fleet. Additionally, enhance observability by implementing AWS X-Ray distributed tracing and custom CloudWatch dashboards for proactive anomaly detection and incident management.
*	Phase 6 - High Availability & Disaster Recovery: Implement Multi-region deployment (Active-Passive) to ensure business continuity and 99.99% availability in the event of a regional service disruption.

| **Amazon S3** | $0.03 | $0.36 | 1 GB Standard storage. |
| **API Gateway** | $0.00 | $0.00 | Covered by AWS Free Tier (est. 1,000 requests/month). |
| **AWS Lambda** | $0.00 | $0.00 | Covered by AWS Free Tier (est. 100 requests/month). |
| **EventBridge** | $0.00 | $0.00 | Covered by AWS Free Tier (est. 10 custom events/month). |
| **TOTAL** | **$37.24** | **$446.88** | **Upfront: $0.00** |

**Assumptions & Cost Optimization Strategies**
1.	**Bedrock Model Specifics**: The AWS Pricing Calculator uses generic identifiers for Bedrock models. This proposal specifically utilizes Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku for low-latency intent detection, Claude 3 Sonnet for reasoning/context, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex Text-to-SQL generation. The estimated cost reflects a blended usage of these models for demonstration purposes.
2.	**VPC Endpoint Optimization**: VPC Interface Endpoints currently account for ~55% of the estimated monthly cost ($20.45). As this is a Proof of Concept (POC), these endpoints can be de-provisioned when not in active testing to significantly reduce actual costs.
3.	**AI Model Usage**: Bedrock costs are variable based on token consumption. The estimate assumes moderate testing traffic; production costs will scale linearly with actual user volume.
4.	**Instance Utilization**: The RDS instance (db.t3.micro) is estimated at 15% utilization. For development environments, the database can be stopped outside of business hours to save approximately 60-70% of the RDS hourly cost.
5.	**Free Tier Leveraging**: The architecture maximizes the use of AWS Free Tier for compute (Lambda), API management (API Gateway), and orchestration (EventBridge) to keep the baseline operational cost minimal.
