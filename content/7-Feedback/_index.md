> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
FCJ creates an incredibly friendly and open working environment. Especially, the mentors and team members are always enthusiastic and ready to help whenever I encounter difficulties at work. The office is neatly arranged and equipped with modern support facilities, helping me work comfortably and professionally.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors provide extremely enthusiastic and detailed guidance, always patiently explaining clearly whenever I don't understand an issue. Particularly, during the process of perfecting the project architecture, they helped me improve the design and identify critical core issues that I hadn't noticed. The admin team is also very dedicated in supporting administrative procedures, providing documents, and creating all favorable conditions for work. I especially appreciate the mentors' teaching method - instead of providing ready answers, they encourage me to think independently, experiment, and solve problems myself, which has helped me learn much more deeply.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**
Although the main knowledge in this period is about cloud, which is quite unrelated to my current major as an AI Engineer, this is a rare opportunity to expand into new areas related to cloud that I have never been exposed to before. Most importantly, I gained a real-world perspective on technical aspects as well as other aspects of how an AI product operates in actual enterprises.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The FCJ internship program provided me with countless opportunities for comprehensive skill development. In terms of technical skills, I learned how to use AWS CDK to deploy Infrastructure as Code, work with AI/ML services like Bedrock, design complex system architectures, and apply prompt engineering in practice. Regarding soft skills, I was trained in using project management tools (Git, Notion, draw.io, Jira, etc.), teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Particularly, the mentors also shared many valuable experiences such as workplace etiquette, effective work styles, interview skills, and foundational knowledge needed to become a professional engineer. These lessons have given me a clearer vision of my career path and how to develop myself in the future.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
FCJ has a very positive and professional work culture. Everyone always respects and supports each other, working seriously but still maintaining a friendly and pleasant atmosphere. Especially, when there are urgent projects or important deadlines, the whole team always stands together, supporting each other regardless of position or rank. This makes me - even though I'm just an intern - still feel valued and an important part of the collective. The company also regularly organizes knowledge-sharing workshops by Mr. Hung and other mentors, which has greatly boosted my spirit of contribution and confidence.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
FCJ has very good policies supporting interns, especially in creating flexible time arrangements when needed to help me balance study and work. Additionally, I was able to participate in events, workshops, and training sessions on cloud computing organized by the company - these are all beneficial activities that help me enhance my professional knowledge and expand my network.

### Advice for Fellow Students

If you have the opportunity to intern at FCJ, I highly recommend you participate. This is truly a great opportunity for you to learn and familiarize yourself with cloud computing - a new, practical technology that is receiving much attention in the industry. The program not only equips solid technical knowledge but also helps you develop soft skills, work in a professional environment, and more importantly, turns your ideas into reality more easily through AWS services.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- I hope the company can organize more meetings and sharing sessions specifically for FPT students to create stronger bonds and learn more from each other's experiences.
- Could add more training sessions on soft skills such as presentation, communication, or career orientation.

**Personal Wishes:**
- I really hope to have the opportunity to continue working with FCJ in the future, whether on larger projects or as a mentorship program for the next generation of interns.
