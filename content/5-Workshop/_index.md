# AI-Powered Schedule Booking Chatbot on AWS

#### Overview

In this workshop, we will build **MeetAssist** — an intelligent chatbot system running on the **AWS Serverless** platform. This solution applies Generative AI (LLM) to automate the process of appointment scheduling and customer information lookup through a Facebook Messenger interface.

Instead of responding based on a fixed rule-based script, the system uses a **Text-to-SQL** model to understand natural language, query real-time data from the database, and provide flexible responses to users.
